## What is typescript?
 
- TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.

- It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.

# Where/How does typescript code run?

- typescript covert in javascript onlything is that it covert in a way life the g++ compiler from c++ to o./out file (let a:number = 10 => let a = 10)

# Typescript code never runs in your browser. Your browser can only understand javascript. 

- Javascript is the runtime language (the thing that actually runs in your browser/nodejs runtime)
- Typescript is something that compiles down to javascript

- When typescript is compiled down to javascript, you get type checking (similar to C++). If there is an error, the conversion to Javascript fails.
