# 📚 Learning Vault – Backend, TypeScript & Real-Time Systems

> This repository is my **structured learning space** where I document backend fundamentals, TypeScript concepts, databases, ORMs, and real-time communication using WebSockets.

This is not a random collection of files.  
It reflects **how I learn, organize knowledge, and think like an engineer**.

---

## 🧠 What This Repository Represents

- My **learning journey**, not just final results
- Concepts explained in **my own words**
- Code written to **understand internals**, not just make things work
- A strong focus on **fundamentals over frameworks**

If you’re an interviewer 👋  
This repo shows **how I approach learning complex backend systems**.

#  PostgreSQL (Database Fundamentals)
**Folder:** `Postgres_database/`

### Focus Areas
- SQL basics with hands-on practice  
- Understanding JOINs, relations, and normalization  
- Transactions and why they matter  
- Writing queries with performance in mind  
- Thinking beyond CRUD operations  

> This section helped me build a strong database foundation before jumping into ORMs.

---

# ORM & Prisma (Abstraction with Understanding)
**Folder:** `ORM_PRISMA/`

### Contents Include
- Prisma fundamentals  
- ORM vs Raw SQL thinking  
- Detailed explanation of migrations  
- Lecture code + personal notes  

### Key Idea
> ORMs are tools — understanding SQL underneath is mandatory.  
> I focus on what Prisma generates, not just how to use it.

---

# TypeScript (Strongly Typed JavaScript)
**Folder:** `Typescript/`

### Topics Covered
- Primitive & non-primitive types  
- Interfaces vs types  
- API-related TypeScript usage  
- Project setup & configuration  
- Writing safer backend code  

### Goal
> Catch bugs at compile time, not in production.  
> This folder reflects my effort to write predictable and maintainable JavaScript.

---

# 🔌 WebSockets (Real-Time Communication)
**Folder:** ` Websocket/`

### What’s Inside
- WebSocket fundamentals  
- Ping-pong communication (backend + frontend)  
- Room-based chat application  
- Handling multiple connections  

### I Explored
- How WebSockets differ from HTTP  
- How real-time data flows  
- How rooms isolate communication  

>  Some WebSocket-based projects live in separate dedicated repositories, while core experiments and concepts are stored here.

---

#  About Projects
This repository mainly focuses on **learning + concepts**.

 **Major projects** (like full chat apps, second-brain apps, etc.) are maintained in **individual repositories** to keep concerns clean and scalable.  
This repo acts as the **foundation** for those projects.

---

#  How This Repo Evolves
- Notes get refined as understanding improves  
- Code gets refactored over time  
- New folders are added as I explore new topics  
- Older concepts get revisited with better clarity  

> This repository is alive, not finished.

---

# 👀 For Interviewers / Recruiters
This repo demonstrates:
- Strong backend fundamentals  
- Comfort with databases & real-time systems  
- Clean organization of learning material  
- Ability to explain complex concepts simply  
- Engineering mindset over framework chasing  

> I believe strong fundamentals + consistency create great engineers.

---

#  Final Note
> This repository represents **how I learn**, not just what I know.  
> I’m learning.  
> I’m building.  
> I’m improving — step by step.  

🙏 Thanks for taking the time to explore!
